2. Select **Swift Packages**.
3. Choose **Add Package Dependency...**.
4. Specify the git URL for Easy_Purchase_Receipt_Validator :

```swift 
https://github.com/BJIT-RnD/Easy-Purchase-Receipt-Validator.git
```

## CocoaPods

Easy Purchase Reciept Validator can be installed as a CocoaPod and builds as a Swift framework. 

To install, include this in your Podfile.

use_frameworks!

pod â€˜Easy_Purchase_Receipt_Validator'
```

## Usage Guidelines

### Intializing with receipt
> 
Our library will ensure that your receipt will be decoded following the rules and will return the decoded data to the developer who will be using our library.

To initiate the validation process, follow these steps:

1. Load the receipt from your bundle's appStoreReceiptURL.

```swift
if let receiptURL = Bundle.main.appStoreReceiptURL,
   FileManager.default.fileExists(atPath: receiptURL.path) {
    let receiptData = try? Data(contentsOf: receiptURL, options: .alwaysMapped)
    do {
        // Continue with the validation process
    } catch {
        // Handle errors during the loading of receipt data
    }
}
```
2. To continue validation process and catch error

```swift
do {
    let appleContainer = try AppleContainer(data: receiptData!)
    let receiptData = try appleContainer.AppleReceipt()
} catch {
    // Handle errors during the parsing of receipt data
    // e.g., print("Error occurred during parsing receipt data")
}
```
Ensure to incorporate these code snippets into your application to effectively load and validate the In-App Purchase Receipt. Adjust error-handling mechanisms based on your application's requirements.

## Receipt Validation 

After getting receiptData successfully from above block, you can check the validty of the data:


```swift
do {
    let receiptValidityCheck = try receiptData.isValidReceipt()
} catch ReceiptError.verificationFailed {
    // Do something if verification is failed
}
```

NOTE: Apple strongly advises conducting receipt validation promptly upon your app's launch. For enhanced security measures, consider periodically rechecking the validation while your application is active. Additionally, in the event of a validation failure on iOS, it is recommended to attempt a receipt refresh initially.

### Accessing Various Information Regarding Validated Receipt

After making sure that you have the validated receipt, you can access various information from the receipt as per your need.

1. Accessing Bundle Identifier
```swift
let bundleIdentifier = receiptData.bundleIdentifier
```
2. Accessing Original AppVersion
```swift
let originalAppVersion = receiptData.originalAppVersion
```
3. Accessing BundleVersion
```swift
let bundleVersion = receiptData.bundleVersion
```
4. Accessing List of Purchases
```swift
guard let purchase = receiptData.purchases else { return }
```
5. Accessing Opaque Value
```swift
let opaqueValue = receiptData.opaqueValue
```
6. Accessing Bundle Identifier Data
```swift
let bundleIdentifierData = receiptData.bundleIdentifierData
```
7. Accessing receiptHash
```swift
let receiptHash = receiptData.receiptHash
```
8. Accessing Receipt Creation Date
```swift
let receiptCreationDate = receiptData.creationDate
```
9. Accessing Receipt Expiration Date
```swift
let receiptExpirationDate = receiptData.expirationDate
```
10. Accessing Receipt Creation Date as String
```swift
let creationDateString = receiptData.creationDateString
```
11. Accessing Receipt Expiration Date as String
```swift
let expirationDateString = receiptData.expirationDateString
```

## N.B.

Easy Purchase Receipt Validator does not retain in-app purchase data on a local level. The responsibility for managing and storing this data falls upon the clients or developers who use this library. They have the flexibility to choose their preferred storage solution, which could include options such as NSUserDefaults, CoreData, or the Keychain. In other words, This library doesn't handle the local storage of in-app purchase information; that task is left to the discretion of the clients, allowing them to select the most suitable method for their specific needs.
