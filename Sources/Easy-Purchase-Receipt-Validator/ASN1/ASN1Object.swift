/**
 The structure of an `ASN.1` (Abstract Syntax Notation One) object typically consists of three main components. `ASN.1 Identifier, Length of the Data, Actual Data`.

 - ASN.1 Identifier: This component specifies the type or tag of the data and provides information about how to interpret the data. It includes details such as whether the data is an integer, a string, a sequence, or other data types.
 - Length of the Data: This component indicates the length of the encoded data in bytes. It can be a simple length encoding for short values or a more complex encoding for longer values.
 - Actual Data: This component contains the actual data, which is often referred to as the "content" or "value." The structure and encoding of the data depend on the ASN.1 type specified in the identifier.
